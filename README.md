# 🌦️ OpenWeather API Data Retrieval and Analysis


## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to **retrieve, analyze, and compare weather data** using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

The notebook connects to the OpenWeather API to:
- Retrieve **current** and **historical** weather data for multiple global cities.
- Compare climate patterns across time (e.g., 1983 vs. present).
- Visualize and export data for further analysis.
